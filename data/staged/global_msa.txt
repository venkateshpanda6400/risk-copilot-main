Subject to Clause 6.3 below and unless otherwise stated in a Quote, a pro rata credit allowance ("Outage Credit")
will be given to CUSTOMER for the total Outage period(s) during any given consecutive twelve (12) month
period, not including the period permitted under the service availability commitment (eg. for a service
availability commitment of 99.5% in any given twelve (12) month period, Outages totaling 0.5% would not be
subject to an Outage Credit).

For telephone and data circuit services, GDS will pass through to the CUSTOMER the service availability that it
receives from its suppliers, if any. In the event of failure or degradation of a telephone or data circuit services
service, GDS will pass through and credit CUSTOMER's account with a rebate equal to the rebate that CDS
receives from its suppliers, if any.

An Outage Credit, if any, will be applied against the charges payable to GDS and will be expressly indicated on
the final invoice to CUSTOMER of the calendar year in which Outage Credit applies, for the period of the Outage,
or prorated portion thereof, after written request to GDS.

No other liability may in any event attach to GDS on account of interruption or failure to provide Services. All
Outage Credit(s) will be treated as liquidated damages and not as penalties. Outage Credit(s) do not apply to
Outages, (i) caused by Force Majeure, (ii) caused by the negligence of CUSTOMER or others authorized by
CUSTOMER when using Services or Products, (iii) caused by power failures or similar occurrences, such as
perforation activity, not provided by or attributable to GDS, (iv) occurring during periods when CUSTOMER has
elected not to allow for testing or repair, (v) caused by rain fade, solar outages or flares, extreme weather, or
